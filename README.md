**HNEveryDay** is a high-performance, privacy-first, AI-enhanced Hacker News client for iOS, built specifically for Geekers who live in the terminal and dream in code.

It combines the raw information density favored by hackers with the fluid, tactile experience of a modern native iOS app.

## ✨ Features

### 🚀 Extreme Performance
- **120fps Scrolling**: Built with optimized SwiftUI lists to handle thousands of items without dropping a frame.
- **Parallel Fetching**: Custom networking layer fetches story metadata and comments in concurrent batches for instant loading.

### 💬 Deep Discussion threads

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Swift 5 language mode
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI (current app deployment target: iOS 18.6)
- **Persistence**: **SwiftData** with optimized "Read-Through" caching.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Setting up AI
1. Tap the **Gear Icon** (⚙️) on the main feed.
2. Select your **Provider Preset** (e.g., DeepSeek).
    - *The App automatically fills the correct Base URL and Model Name.*
3. Paste your **API Key**. The app never bundles provider secrets.
4. (Optional) You can manually edit the Model Name to use specific versions (default: `deepseek-v4-flash`).
5. Tap **Done**. Keys are stored securely on-device using iOS Keychain.

## 📥 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/corlin/HNEveryDay.git
   ```
2. Open `HNEveryDay.xcodeproj` in a recent Xcode that supports the configured iOS deployment target. This repo is currently verified with Xcode 26.5.
3. Build and Run on your iPhone or Simulator.

## ✅ Testing

Run the unit test target with an available iOS Simulator:

```bash
xcodebuild test -project HNEveryDay.xcodeproj -scheme HNEveryDay -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' -derivedDataPath build/DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

Current coverage focuses on Markdown export, HTML cleanup, AI summary prompt construction, and comment tree flattening.
