Smoke note: on 2026-06-08, installed and launched the Debug app on iPhone 17 Pro Max Simulator (`CBA84A70-F9C4-4945-87D6-9B8AE5DF0B14`). The first-launch onboarding screen rendered correctly. After presetting `has_completed_onboarding`, the Hacker News feed loaded top stories. Deeper interaction checks remain manual until UI tapping automation is available.

## Known Limits Before Release

- AI summaries require the user to bring a compatible API key.
- Reader parsing depends on each article site's markup and can fall back to web view.
- Manual App Store archive/export validation is not covered by the simulator test run.

## Release Steps

- [ ] Complete Smoke QA.
- [ ] Confirm `CHANGELOG.md` is updated.
- [ ] Confirm working tree is clean.
- [ ] Create release tag, for example `v1.0-rc1`.
- [ ] Push tag to origin.
